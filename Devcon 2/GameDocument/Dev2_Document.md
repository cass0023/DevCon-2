   **Define the desired game mechanic or feature**. What are you making?
-
- We decided to work on the **Catch & Collect** mechanic. In a simple and dynamic way, we created a game prototype where the goal is to collect ingredients to make magical recipes. We wanted to focus the design on a pixel style, dynamic and entertaining, providing a good option for temporary entertainment
---
  **Outline an objective statement for the design**. What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?
- 
- We didn't focus on answering a design question as a solution. Instead, we planned it with the idea of fulfilling an entertainment need. It's an easily accessible application for all audiences and ages.
---
  **Detail design rationale**. What do you envision? How is it innovative or experimental?
---
- We could call it an experimental design, as more elements can still be added during development, such as the functionality of the potions. Each potion could offer a benefit, and the game has a wide range of possibilities since it's set in a magical environment. This gives the designer the opportunity to add various new mechanics (enemies, power up, increase level).
