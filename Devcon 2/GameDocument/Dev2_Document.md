   **Define the desired game mechanic or feature**. What are you making?
-
- We decided to work on the **Catch & Collect** mechanic. In a simple and dynamic way, we created a game prototype where the goal is to collect ingredients to make magical recipes. We wanted to focus the design on a pixel style, dynamic and entertaining, providing a good option for temporary entertainment
---
  **Outline an objective statement for the design**. What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?
- 
- We didn't focus on answering a design question as a solution. Instead, we planned it with the idea of fulfilling an entertainment need. It's an easily accessible application for all audiences and ages.
---
  **Detail design rationale**. What do you envision? How is it innovative or experimental?
---
- We could call it an experimental design, as more elements can still be added during development, such as the functionality of the potions. Each potion could offer a benefit, and the game has a wide range of possibilities since it's set in a magical environment. This gives the designer the opportunity to add various new mechanics (enemies, power up, increase level).

**Aditional Information**

**Planning of the concept.(History)**
 - The foundation of the game was designed with a mindset of progression, telling the story of a young witch and her journey in learning magic. The player's ultimate goal will be to complete the witch's grimoire with all the potions she creates and learns about in each level, so she can graduate properly from her school of magic. Throughout this adventure, the player will need to collect the indicated ingredients in each level. The more spells the player knows, the more challenging the game will become, requiring the player to refer to their grimoire at certain times to solve puzzles and defeat various enemies. Future mechanics would include combat, skills, and other varied elements that the game's foundation allows for. A dynamic application for all ages and for those interested in magic.
